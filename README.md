# ngol8
repository for my ngol8 cpu, WIP
file descriptions:
  genrom.py:
    python script that generates ngol's rom file 'romn'
  logisim-generic-2.7.1.jar:
    mother-program, ngol runs on logisim; ran with java
  ngol_assembler.py:
    python script that converts human readable text to ngol's bytecode
  ngol.circ
    the actual cpu itself, open this file within logisim
  all else:
    all else is currently either test input files or test output files

goal:
  the goal of this is to explore the layers of abstraction from low level computer to higher level computing,
  done in my spare time.
